## How To Type Urdu (daddydave).apkg

Anki flashcards to accompany a YouTube video I made. I intended the [How To Type Urdu](https://youtu.be/hWgh3ceHAeQ) video to stand alone,
 since a lot of the Urdu typing mnemonics are obvious, such as a t for ت and r for ر. So please watch the video first, perhaps more than 
once. But x for ش is not so obvious, and it is for these for which I ended up creating Anki flashcards. Ideally for me, you don't need an
 explanation of Spaced Repetition Systems and why Anki is the best. I will simply say you may want to immediately suspend every card 
tagged *TypeUrduSoundalikes* to hide most of the "obvious" ones. 

## urdu_multisearch.html

A custom version of the [Fluent Forever legacy multisearch](https://blog.fluent-forever.com/multi-search/), specifically for Urdu. It will look up the word entered on a few different sites, such as Forvo, Glosbe, Tatoeba, Google Images, etc.

I added a reset button to close the tabs opened.

To use, just download the file and run it locally in your browser. You will be able to customize it for your own language learning or other purposes. (I have a version of this that searches my favorite recipe sites.) Look for a tiny address bar prompt to enable popups the first time you search for a word. If you don't see it, the popup setting will be in your browser settings.

## urdu_multisearch.ico

Optional favicon to use with urdu_multisearch.html (I was using as a Vivaldi side panel icon). Thanks [favicon.io](https://favicon.io)

## UrduLigatures.ods

A workbook (compatible with LibreOffice and Microsoft Excel) to help you pick your favorite Urdu font. (Go [Jameel Noori Nastaleeq](https://urdu.ca/1) or go home, I say.) To use it, install all candidate fonts that are capable of displaying Urdu in a Nastaleeq style on your system. Bulk change the font of the whole worksheet. Print out if necessary. Then repeat until you run out of candidate fonts. This seemed more broadly compatible than using macros to do the same. The exact ligatures chosen come from [C. M. Naim's chart](https://franpritchett.com/00urdu/urduscript/graphics/naimchart.gif).
