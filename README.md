## urdu_multisearch.html

This is a custom version of the [Fluent Forever legacy multisearch](https://blog.fluent-forever.com/multi-search/), specifically for Urdu. It will look up the word entered on a few different sites, such as Forvo, Glosbe, Tatoeba, Google Images, etc.

I added a reset button to close the tabs opened.

To use, just download the file and run it locally in your browser. You will be able to customize it for your own language learning or other purposes. (I have a version of this that searches my favorite recipe sites.) Look for a tiny address bar prompt to enable popups the first time you search for a word. If you don't see it, the popup setting will be in your browser settings.
